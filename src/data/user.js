			"A coding curiosity (thanks Bitcoin) in late 2022 developed into a passion. My specialty at the moment is <strong>frontend development</strong>; however, I am actively researching backend technologies to build additional personal projects and add to my portfolio. These projects include, but are not limited to, tools for <strong>non-KYC verification</strong> and <strong>distinguishing AI generated content from non-AI.</strong>",

		description:
			`My professional background is in ad tech. Most recently I was a solution engineer and collaborated with our sales team during the DSP pre sale cycle. This included giving SaaS product demos and coordinating the completion of RFIs. Additionally, I would provide platform improvement ideas to our product team based on client feedback and my own experience while being a hands on key user. When I'm not coding, I am an avid endurance athlete, home chef, bookworm, and DIYer who is as avid about 
            those things as one can be while being a new dad.`,
