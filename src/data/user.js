		title: "Get to know me!",
		description:
			`With a solid background in ad tech, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and client-facing experience to the table. In my most recent role as a solution engineer, I collaborated closely with the sales team throughout the pre-sale cycle for our demand-side platform (DSP). This involved conducting SaaS product demonstrations, coordinating responses to RFIs, and leveraging my hands-on platform knowledge to provide valuable insights and improvement ideas to the product team based on client feedback.

            Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid endurance athlete, chef, reader, home improvement DIYer, Bitcoiner, and sports fan (go Bills!). These varied interests not only fuel my personal growth but also contribute to my well-rounded perspective and a relentless desire to learn.
            
            As a new father, I have mastered the art of balancing multiple priorities while maintaining a strong work ethic and commitment to excellence. I thrive in dynamic environments that demand adaptability, creative problem-solving, and an unwavering pursuit of continuous improvement.`,
